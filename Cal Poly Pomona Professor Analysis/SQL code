two questions so far 
-- We are trying to improve students experience with profs. Should we have training for professors to teach how to be more helpful and clear when teaching.
aka find if there is a correlation between teachers who are called "helpful" or "clear" and a higher avg rating and answer if we should give the training a shot.
-- we are trying to improve students overall professor experierence. should we limit or encourage the increase of the number of courses a teacher is allowed to teach? or not do anything?
aka Is there a correlation between a professor’s number of courses taught per semester and ratings?
more courses, lower ratings?
less courses, higher ratings?
vice versa
answer if we should test limiting/inreasing the amount of courses a professor is allowed to teach or nahh.
if yes correlation, should we then go for limiting or increasing? find which has higher correlation.

--With correlation: Causation can be explored, but be cautious and consider all possible explanations.
Explore causation by  for example limiting the amount of courses professors are allowed to teach or providing training to professors to help imrpove their clarity and helpfullness. so if yes correlation, pron should test training/limit courses

--Without correlation: Causation may not be worth exploring unless there are strong theoretical or domain-based reasons to suspect a hidden causal link.

more possible questions 
-- What percentage of a department's professors fall below a 3.0 average quality rating, and how has this trended over time?
aka which department should be getting more attention for improvement

-- Which professors show significant improvements or declines in average quality over the last 3 years? What changed (more courses, check comments, etc.)?
aka which professors started to fall off over the last 3 years. query comments to possibly find out why. or just leave it at finding out who and use some general solution like "more teaching training/have a talk to discuss possible issues" 
-- Are newer post covid professors (those who started appearing post-2023) performing better or worse than longer-tenured ones?
aka comparatively are post 2023 teachers better perfomring than pre 2023 profesosrs that were already at cpp. post covid professors vs longer-tenured professors. we can do some general answer like if yes "yes post covid profs perfome better, we should do surveys to see why and possible implement system changes to get long tenured profs to adapt" 
WE ONLY NEED 3-4 QUESTIONS
